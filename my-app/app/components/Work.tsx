        I worked as a Freelance Web Developer from June 2024 to January 2025,
        where I designed, developed, and maintained a responsive and
        user-friendly website for Nail Envy. This project involved creating a
        modern and visually appealing platform to showcase the salon's services,
        customer reviews, and more, as well as providing ongoing updates and
        maintenance to ensure its functionality and relevance.

        During my time as a freelancer, I specialized in both front-end and
        back-end development, leveraging technologies like React.js, Tailwind
        CSS, and Node.js.

        I am now pursuing my education full-time toward a degree in Software
        Engineering at Kennesaw State University. While focusing on my studies,
        I continue working on personal coding projects to enhance my skills and
        stay current with industry trends.
